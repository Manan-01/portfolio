  <h1 class="mb-3">Bank Management System</h1>
  <p>
    The Bank Management System is a full-stack web application developed using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and basic <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>. 
    The primary goal of this project is to simulate real-world banking operations in a digital environment, offering a secure and user-friendly platform for managing personal and administrative banking tasks.
  </p>

  <h2>🧩 Core Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> A secure login and registration system for both users and admins using hashed passwords and sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Dashboard:</strong> Displays user's current balance, recent transactions, and account details after login.</li>
    <li><strong>Deposit/Withdrawal:</strong> Users can perform deposits or withdrawals, and their balance updates in real-time in the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction History:</strong> Each user’s transaction activity is logged and can be reviewed via the dashboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong> Admins can create/edit/delete user accounts and view overall transaction logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 for UI styling and responsiveness</li>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP for server-side logic and form processing</li>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL for storing user data, transaction history, and account details</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Session management, input sanitization, and form validation to prevent SQL Injection and unauthorized access</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The aim of this project was to simulate the core functionalities of a real banking system with a clear, modular structure that can be scaled in the future. It was developed with best practices in mind, including separation of concerns between frontend and backend, and use of secure query execution.
  </p>

  <h2>📌 Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding relational database design and SQL query optimization</li>
    <li>Implementing secure user login systems using PHP sessions</li>
    <li>Building CRUD operations through form inputs and database linking</li>
    <li>Using Bootstrap to create responsive and clean UI components</li>
    <li>Debugging and testing for real-time functionality</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚀 Future Enhancements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Integrate email notifications for transactions</li>
    <li>Add two-factor authentication for improved security</li>
    <li>Create an API-based version for mobile app integration</li>
    <li>Visual dashboards for admins to track all users and finances</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔗 Project Type & Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This project was part of my academic portfolio and helped me gain a deeper understanding of how traditional systems like banking can be translated into web solutions. It’s suitable as a beginner to intermediate level project for those learning web development and backend integration.
  </p>

  <h2>👨‍💻 Role & Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    I was the sole developer on this project and was responsible for everything — from planning the database schema, writing backend logic, designing UI, testing functionality, and debugging code. This end-to-end exposure gave me confidence in handling independent modules in larger software systems.
